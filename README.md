# Adventure-react
This is a project intended to implement a rudimentary adventure game mechanics in React.

## What is an adventure game?
The primary aim of this code is to create a bare-bones, highly minimalistic interpretation of an adventure game. The game Advenure for the Atari 2600 would be a good analogue.
